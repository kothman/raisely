	<div class="question-text">
	  Why would I be a good fit for the Customer Success Engineer role?
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
	  <p>I believe I have the right mix of compassion, writing skills, and technical knowledge to build strong relationships with Raisely customers, and go above and beyond what is required of me. I have two years of experience providing technical support via chat, email, and screenshares to technical and non-technical users while working remotely for a SaaS company called FormAssembly. More recently, I’ve started ghostwriting recruitment emails for Sourceress customers.</p>
	  <p>I joined the FormAssembly team in 2015, providing customer support to users creating web forms. I quickly realized that I could take on more responsibility at the company, and found myself helping with minor bug fixes and maintaining an internal chrome extension after only six months. I also helped bridge the communication gap between our developers and the support team, as well as providing communication between customers and developers. I became the go-to member on the support team for pretty much anything that was more technical in nature. Because FormAssembly integrates with a suite of other software, I found myself constantly learning new APIs, as well as doing in depth troubleshooting when a bug arose with one of the integrations.</p>
	  <p>I like to share my experience at FormAssembly because it does a great job of demonstrating my passion for learning. I'm not content with the status quo, and I think that this job would enable me to continue growing and learning over the years.</p>

      <section class="question">
	<div class="question-text">
	  Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
	  <p>I want to work at Raisely because I think the role would be a great fit, I'm passionate about technology that makes a difference, and I get the impression that Raisely takes care of its employees.</p>
	  <p>The first thing that caught my eye about this position was the responsibilities and requirements - it's basically my dream job. I've been looking for a customer success engineer position where I can thrive, and I think this is it. I love helping folks figure out solutions to their problems, and it's so much more rewarding when the problem isn't a simple one. I absolutely thrive on finding and fixing problems, and welcome an environment that enables me to grow with the company.</p>
	  <p>Upon researching Raisely a little further, I was impressed by the mission and pricing that reflects said mission. I believe technology should improve the quality of life for everyone living on this planet, and was excited to read about how Raisely exists to "create a more just, equal and sustainable world." I can tell that this isn't just a bluff, given that Raisely doesn't take a cut from any donations.</p>
	  <p>Finally, I get the sense that Raisely appreciates and takes care of their employees. Not a lot of companies provide a competitive salary, along with retreats, technology, and annual leave, especially for a support position. That being said, I'd love to hear more about why you all at Raisely enjoy working there!</p>

	  Look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/tommaitland/193b189f80d15309f4bfc475a3a7e81e" target="_blank">this list of tasks</a> and tell us which two you are excited by, which two you want to learn and the two you don’t want to do.
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
	  <p class="answer-heading">Two tasks that I'm excited about</p>
	  <p><b>1. Working with developers to debug and resolve a product issue</b></p>
	  <p>This is the kind of task that gets my gears spinning! I love troubleshooting product issues and figuring out the cause (if I can) before even sending a bug report over to the developers, but I know when and how to involve developers if something is outside my area of expertise.</p>
	  <p><b>2. Change the fonts and background color on someone's campaign</b></p>
	  <p>While it's a somewhat simple task, a lot of folks don't know how to do this on their own - something as small as showing a customer how to change their font and background color can make all the difference!
	  <p class="answer-heading">Two tasks that I want to learn</p>
	  <p><b>1. Importing data into a new Kepla account</b></p>
	  <p>I didn't know what Kepla was until I looked it up - I have (just shy of) three years experience professionally using Salesforce, and I'm pretty excited to learn the ins and outs of any CRM that isn't Salesforce!</p>
	  <p><b>2. Create a video tutorial on how to set up a campaign</b></p>
	  <p>I have experience creating and updating knowledge base articles, but I've never actually recorded an instructional video. I think I'd enjoy doing so, but I could definitely use some pointers to get started.</p>
	  <p class="answer-heading">Two tasks I don't want to do (or rather, I'm not as excited to do)</p>
	  <p><b>1. Create engaging content for social media and digital marketing</b></p>
	  <p>This isn't really my strong suit, and I don't have experience creating this type of content, but I'd definitely be happy to learn and help out how I can.</p>
	  <p><b>2. Coordinating regular blog posts for our blog from the team</b></p>
	  <p>In a similar vein to creating social media and digital marketing content, this isn't something I excel at.</p>

      <section class="question">
	<div class="question-text">
	  Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they’re good.
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
	  <p>I recently had to update my bank account in Stripe and contacted support to make the change. Overall, it was painless process, and I hadn't thought about it much until just now. Here's a quick rundown of what happened.</p>
	  <p>To start, I hopped on chat with a support specialist. I had no trouble figuring out how to start a chat session, and the person on the other end was knowledgeable and friendly - I felt like they wanted to help me, and knew how to do so. They informed me that they needed to give me a call to verify that I was who I said I was - I got the call, verified some information on my account, and we were good to go!</p>
	  <p>While this was a pretty straightforward support interaction, there are a couple things worth noting. The support specialists were knowledgeable about the product, and it showed. In addition to being knowledgeable, they also used friendly and positive language, making the conversation feel natural. Finally, they were very attentive to my needs - I really got the feeling that everyone I spoke to wanted to help me out to the best of their abilities, and they made sure I didn't have any lingering questions before ending the conversation.</p>

	  PS - I live in the United States
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
	  <p>Bozeman, Montana, to be precise! I noticed that your job listing requires that I can work at least 5 hours a day within GMT+10, so I just wanted to let you know that this wouldn't be a problem - I'm more than happy to work in the evenings (which lines up with Australian Eastern Standard Time mornings), and I happen to be a bit of a night owl anyway.</p>
